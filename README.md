Estimated GFR using Cystatin C

This Shiny app allows calculation of an estimated GFR using multiple input variables.

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a measure of renal function, usually measured directly in a long and somewhat invasive procedure.  It is possible to estimate GFR but the formulae are either simple and inaccurate in children (such as the bedside Schwarz equation), or more accurate but extremely complex, involving many input variables and either logarithmic conversions or multiple exponential calculations.  This could lead to significant possibility for error.  This app provides automatic calculation using 3 such formulae and a recommendation at the end as to whether enough doubt exists to go on to formally measure GFR.

Cystatin C is a metabolite measured in blood and usually measured in mg/L.  Values are usually between 0.4 and 1.5 mg/L.

Creatinine is a metabolite measured in blood and is measured in either umol/L or mg/dL.  
To convert a value in mg/dL to umol/L multiply by 88.5.  Values are usually between 20 and 140 umol/L.

Urea is a metabolite measured in blood and is measured in mmol/L or as Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) measured in mg/dL.
To convert a value in mg/dL to mmol/L multiply by 0.357.  Values are usually between 2 and 7 mmol/L.

Height is the patient's height measured in centimetres.

Male and female is entered using capital M for male or capital F for female.

Output is an estimated GFR measured in ml/min/1.73m2 using 3 different formulae.  

A recommendation is given depending on the results of these formulae based on research done at the Royal Children's Hospital validating a simplified formula for estimated GFR (RCH formula) with appropriate sensitivity and specificity for detecting renal dysfunction in children with cancer.
